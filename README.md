# Hi, I'm Jordi! ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m an aspiring software engineer who loves building websites and learning new things.
Right now, Iâ€™m focused on system design and improving my full-stack web development skills.

I know the fundamentals of web development, and Iâ€™ve recently worked with Next.js to create several full-stack applications.

Outside of coding, I enjoy hiking, exploring nature, and wandering through the city to find new places.
